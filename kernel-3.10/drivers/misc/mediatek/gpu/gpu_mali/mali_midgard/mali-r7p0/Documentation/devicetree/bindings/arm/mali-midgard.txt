* ARM Mali Midgard devices


Required properties:

- compatible : Should be mali<chip>, replacing digits with x from the back,
until malit<Major>xx, ending with arm,mali-midgard, the latter not optional.
- reg : Physical base address of the device and length of the register area.
- interrupts : Contains the three IRQ lines required by T-6xx devices
- interrupt-names : Contains the names of IRQ resources in the order they were
provided in the interrupts property. Must contain: "JOB, "MMU", "GPU".

Optional:

- clocks : Phandle to clock for the Mali T-6xx device.
- clock-names : Shall be "clk_mali".
- mali-supply : Phandle to regulator for the Mali device. Refer to
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt for details.
- operating-points : Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/opp.txt
for details.
- snoop_enable_smc : SMC function ID to enable CCI snooping on the GPU port(s).
- snoop_disable_smc : SMC function ID to disable CCI snooping on the GPU port(s).
- jm_config : For T860/T880. Sets job manager configuration. An array containing:
	- 1 to override the TIMESTAMP value, 0 otherwise.
	- 1 to override clock gate, forcing them to be always on, 0 otherwise.
	- 1 to enable job throttle, limiting the number of cores that can be started
	  simultaneously, 0 otherwise.
	- Value between 0 and 63 (including). If job throttle is enabled, this is one
	  less than the number of cores that can be started simultaneously.

Example for a Mali-T602:

gpu@0xfc010000 {
	compatible = "arm,malit602", "arm,malit60x", "arm,malit6xx", "arm,mali-midgard";
	reg = <0xfc010000 0x4000>;
	interrupts = <0 36 4>, <0 37 4>, <0 38 4>;
	interrupt-names = "JOB", "MMU", "GPU";

	clocks = <&pclk_mali>;
	clock-names = "clk_mali";
	mali-supply = <&vdd_mali>;
	operating-points = <
		/* KHz   uV */
		533000 1250000,
		450000 1150000,
		400000 1125000,
		350000 1075000,
		266000 1025000,
		160000  925000,
		100000  912500,
	>;
};
